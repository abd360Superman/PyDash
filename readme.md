### Description:

PyDash is a programming language that has been coded with the help of Python. It's syntax is mix of the following programming languages:

1. JavaScript
2. Lua
3. QBASIC
4. Python

PyDash, like C, is **not** an object-oriented programming language. However, like most programming languages, the following abilities and commands are available amongst others:

Usage | Keyword(s) / Syntax
--- | ---
Making Variables | VAR
Loops | WHILE and FOR
Arrays | []
Conditionals | IF, THEN, ELIF, ELSE
Functions | FUN

I made PyDash so that a simple syntax would be available to make bigger and bigger programs. This would make your codes look neater, as well as easier to write.

To make a PyDash program, you would need to make sure you have the following tools installed:

1. A Python Interpreter
2. Git Bash
3. Visual Studio Code

Next, run the following commands to create and execute your first PyDash Program!

```
$ git clone https://github.com/abd360Superman/PyDash.git
$ cd PyDash
$ code myfile.pydash
$ python shell.py
pydash > RUN("myfile.pydash")
```

2 Code examples are included to help you in getting started! If you are a Python Expert, you could try to figure out the entire code by yourself, and even modify the code to add some functionalities.
